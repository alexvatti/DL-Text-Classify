## Overview 
In this project, we've harnessed the power of deep learning to tackle the fascinating task of text classification. 
Whether it's categorizing emails or analyzing movie reviews, our approach leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) 
to accurately interpret and classify text data.

**Key Features:**

- Email Classification:
   Sorting emails into categories like spam or ham. This helps in managing inboxes efficiently and ensures important messages aren't missed.

- Movie Review Sentiment Analysis:
   Determining the sentiment behind movie reviews, whether positive or negative. This provides valuable insights into audience reactions and trends.
